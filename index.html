                        <p>My name is Alex Chan and I am from Bairnsdale, a small regional town in eastern Victoria. I
                            was born in Australia and raised by my mother and father who both emigrated from Hong Kong
                            to Australia. While English is my first language, I can speak Cantonese at a conversational
                            level with my relatives, but I do not have the ability to read or write in it. During Years
                            11 and 12 I completed Computing and Software Development subjects as a part of my VCE, while
                            they were not strictly prerequisites to my university degree, having a sound understanding
                            of the basics in computing was important. I have been studying at RMIT since 2019, currently
                            it is my second year studying a Bachelor of Computer and Network Engineering. I have taken
                            Introduction to Information Technology as an elective subject. Ever since I was a child, I
                            have enjoyed playing single-player video games, such as open-world RPGs and indie games. I
                            also have a large interest in computer hardware, especially surrounding gaming PCs. Anything
                            from reading about the latest hardware news to building and customising my own desktop
                            computer. I also own a dog, an 8-year-old Papillon named Radar who always loves to eat and
                            sleep.
